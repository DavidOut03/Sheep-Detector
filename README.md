# 🐑 AI-Powered Animal Detection for Dyke Inspection

This project is part of a research initiative by the Data-Driven Smart Society (DDSS) research group, in collaboration with Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier (HHNK). The current goal is to explore whether animals can be effectively detected in infrared drone imagery — using sheep as the test subject.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The focus of this proof-of-concept is to determine if AI models can detect animals, specifically **sheep**, in thermal images captured by drones. Sheep are used in this phase because they are larger and easier to label than other animals of interest, like muskrats. 

While **muskrats** pose a more serious threat to dyke integrity due to their burrowing behavior, they are harder to detect and may require further research. This project lays the groundwork for that future work by testing detection feasibility on easier targets.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Train and evaluate an object detection model to find sheep in infrared drone images
- Test detection performance on small, low-resolution objects
- Provide insight into the feasibility of animal detection in this context
- Lay the foundation for future detection of more elusive animals (e.g. muskrats)
